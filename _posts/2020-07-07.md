##### Graphs in Bash
It's been a while since the last post. I found an interesting file that I tried 
to implement [Bellman-Ford Algorithm] in bash. It was for a project in a 
networking course, which I eventually implemented in C++.

##### Bellman-Ford
[Bellman-Ford Algorithm] is an algorithm to compute the shortest paths from a 
source node to all other nodes in a [weighted graph]. It is slower than 
[Dijkstra's algorithm] because it relaxes all the edges in every iteration, and 
does this |V| - 1 times where |V| is the number of vertices whereas Dijkstra's 
algorithm greedily selects the minimum-weight node that has not been processed 
yet. However, the Bellman-Ford algorithm is still used because it can process 
graphs with negative edges.  


##### Algorithm and Implementation
First of all, we need to implement a graph-like data structure. I ended up using 
global variables since bash does not support classes. I'd like to know if there 
is any other way to do it. We need a mutable variable from any scope for vertices 
and edges.
```bash
declare -A vertices=()
declare -A edges=()
```
We would assume that the input is an array of strings whose elements represent 
edges. Each string has a source node name, destination name, and distance 
separated by a space, respectively. We'll then need a function to initialize 
those two variables.
```bash
# Add an edge to the graph
addEdge() {
    p1="$1"
    p2="$2"
    p3="$3"
    vertices["$p1"]+=" $p2"
    edges["$p1"_"$p2"]="$p3"
}

# Initialize the graph with an array of strings
graph() {
    Edges=$1 
    for edge in "${Edges[@]}"; do
        addEdge "$edge"
    done
}
```
It doesn't look pleasant, but I could not come up with any other way to 
represent edges other than having an array of strings that has names of the 
source node and destination node separated by `_`. To implement the algorithm, 
we need an array to keep distances from the source node to all other nodes and a 
 boolean variable to keep track if the graph has a negative weight cycle, which 
 makes the output of this algorithm incorrect. Then, it will iterate through 
 edges and relaxes its weight in the process.

The process can be summarized as:
1. Initialize all elements in `distances` to infinity
2. Set the distance to the source node to 0
3. Calculate the distance. Do following steps |V|-1 times
   - For each edge u_v, do the following:  
     If `distances[v]` is greater than the sum of the weight u_v and `distances[u]`  
     - Update `distances[v]` with the sum of the weight u_v and `distances[u]`
     
4. Check if there is a negative weight cycle in the edge
   - For each edge u_v:  
     If `distances[v]` is less than the sum of the weight u_v and `distances[u]`  
     - Set `negative_edge` to `true`

Following these steps, the implementation would look like this:
```bash
bellman_ford() {
    INT_MAX=$((2 ** 32))
    
    declare -A local distances=()
    local source=$3
    local negative_cycle=false
    
    # Set all distances to infinity (step 1)
    for vertex in "${!vertices[@]}"; do
        distances[$vertex]=$INT_MAX
    done

    # Init distance of source to 0 (step 2)
    distances[$source]=0
    
    # Compute the shortest path (step 3)
    for ((i = 0; i < ${#vertices[@]} - 1; ++i)); do
        for u in "${!vertices[@]}"; do
            for v in "${!vertices[@]}"; do
                if [ -n "${edges[${u}_$v]}" ]; then
                    distance=$((distances[$u] + edges[${u}_$v]))
                    distances[$v]=$((distance < distances[$v] ? distance : distances[${v}]))
                fi
            done
        done
    done
    
    # Detect negative weight cycle (step 4)
    for u in "${!vertices[@]}"; do
        for v in "${!vertices[@]}"; do
           if [ -n "${edges[${u}_$v]}" ]; then
               distance=$((distances[$u] + edges[${u}_$v]))
               if [ distance -lt distances[$v] ]; then
                   negative_cycle=true
               fi
           fi
        done
    done
    
    if [ $negative_cycle ]; then
        echo "Detected negative cycles"
    fi
}
```
