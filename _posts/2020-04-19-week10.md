##### Talk by Gil Yehuda

##### Inkscape
This week, I opened my first merge request. Since the ci project is not as
important compared to the main Inkscape project, This will probably take some
more time for a review. For the team, we are meeting today (04-05-2020) on
Discord.

> Completed:
> - Fixed (hopefully) the issue that I opened on `inkscape-ci-docker`
> - Made a merge request with the above fix

> Todos:
> - Working on [this issue][issue_472]


##### Outside Activity
> Completed:
> - OSM:
    - Added a pond near my house
> - Wikipedia:
    - Edited a page of the [city][Toyohashi] I was born, which had incorrectly 
    formatted info section.

##### Shell Script
As fixing the issue, I learned a new stuff that could be useful for some people. 
The problem is something like this, given a string `genres` that includes one or
more string(s) representing the genre(s) of a musical artist or group, and 
`genre` that represents a specific genre of music. Find if `genres` contains the
string `genre`. It's the simplest substring problem, but trying stuff in a new 
language is sometimes not that simple. I first tried with the [`grep`][grep]. 
A command
``` bash 
echo "Blues Jazz Gospel" | grep -o "Jazz"
```
generates an output `"Jazz"` meaning the string `"Jazz"` is a substring of
`"Jazz Blues Gospel"`. To make the matching case-insensitive, adding `-i` option 
to the `grep` will do it. Since I need a boolean value, the script looks 
something like: 
``` bash
#!/bin/bash

input="blues jazz gospel"
target="jazz"

if [[ $(echo "$input" | grep "$target") ]]; 
    then
        printf '%s is in "%s"\n' "$target" "$input"
    else
        printf '%s is not in "%s"\n' "$target" "$input"
fi
```
Although it works, the condition looks too much for this simple step. Then,
I found a way to achieve this (from [this post][stack_overflow]). It uses a 
Linux command-line tool called Standard [Wildcards]. The man page says,  
"*`*` or an asterisk can represent any number of characters 
(including zero, in other words, zero or more characters). If you specified a 
"cd\*" it would use "cda", "cdrom", "cdrecord" and anything that starts with 
“cd” also including “cd” itself. "m\*l" could by mill, mull, ml, and anything 
that starts with an m and ends with an l.*"  
which means "`*jazz*`" will match "`blues jazz gospel`". Therefore, the if
statement from the above script can be rewritten as:
``` bash
if [[ "$input" == *"$target"* ]];
```
This looks much better and could be useful for some other cases.
