##### Talk by Gil Yehuda
We had a guest speaker Gil Yehuda, who is working at Verison Media as a Sr. 
Director of the Open Source department. I appreciate his spending time with our 
class. His main point was how essential for us to (especially for students 
looking for a job) to be involved with open-source projects. Contributing to a 
project with quality validates your skills because that means the maintainers 
officially accept your work. One of my classmates had a question about managing 
our confidence. Thanks to the person who asked about it since I wanted to ask 
the same thing. He responded to the question that all of us have Impostor 
syndrome. Then, he gave us an example of a Violinist who responded, "I do it 
fourteen hours every day" when he was told how talented he is. This example 
illustrates one of my perspectives about saying if one is "talented" or not. 
I am not to say that if such a thing doesn't exist, and I rather believe it 
does. However, to me, expressing that a person is "talented" just because one 
is capable of something is meaningless. That is because what you are mentioning 
could be just a normal thing for that person, and at the same time, more 
importantly, it could be disrespectful if he/she has been making a lot of effort 
to it.


##### Inkscape
This week, I opened my first merge request. Since the ci project is not as
important compared to the main Inkscape project, This will probably take some
more time for a review. For the team, we are meeting today (04-05-2020) on
Discord.

> Completed:
> - Fixed (hopefully) the issue that I opened on `inkscape-ci-docker`
> - Made a merge request with the above fix
> - Fixed some typo on one of Umar's blog

> Todos:
> - Working on [this issue][issue_472]


##### Outside Activity
> Completed:
> - OSM:
    - Added a pond near my house
> - Wikipedia:
    - Edited a page of the [city][Toyohashi] I was born, which had incorrectly 
    formatted info section.

> Todos:
> - **Blog Editing**

##### Shell Script
As fixing the issue, I learned a new stuff that could be useful. The problem is 
something like this, given a string `genres` that includes one or more string(s)
representing the genre(s) of a musical artist or group, and `genre` that 
represents a specific genre of music. Find if `genres` contains the string 
`genre`. It's the simplest substring problem, but trying stuff in a new language 
is sometimes not that simple. I first tried with the [`grep`][grep]. The command
``` bash 
echo "Blues Jazz Gospel" | grep -o "Jazz"
```
generates an output `"Jazz"` meaning the string `"Jazz"` is a substring of
`"Jazz Blues Gospel"`. To make the matching case-insensitive, adding `-i` option 
to the `grep` will do it. Since I need a boolean value, the script looks 
something like: 
``` bash
#!/bin/bash

input="blues jazz gospel"
target="jazz"

if [[ $(echo "$input" | grep "$target") ]]; 
    then
        printf '%s is in "%s"\n' "$target" "$input"
    else
        printf '%s is not in "%s"\n' "$target" "$input"
fi
```
Although it works, the condition looks too much for this simple step. Then,
I found a way to achieve this (from [this post][stack_overflow]). It uses a 
Linux command-line tool called Standard [Wildcards]. The man page says,  
"*`*` or an asterisk can represent any number of characters 
(including zero, in other words, zero or more characters). If you specified a 
"cd\*" it would use "cda", "cdrom", "cdrecord" and anything that starts with 
“cd” also including “cd” itself. "m\*l" could by mill, mull, ml, and anything 
that starts with an m and ends with an l.*"  
which means "`*jazz*`" will match "`blues jazz gospel`". Therefore, the if
statement from the above script can be rewritten as:
``` bash
if [[ "$input" == *"$target"* ]];
```
This looks much better and could be useful for some other cases.
