##### How would I like to contribute?
Until recently, I did not know that writing some code is not the only way to
contribute to open source. For example, you can contribute by improving or
translating their documentation, suggesting a new feature to the project, or
even helping to organize some events and more. These are all respectable ways to
contribute to open-source projects. Those might not be the fanciest ways, as a
beginner, I think I should focus on writing, improving, or translating
documentation over the semester. Off course, it would be great if I do that by
writing some code.
