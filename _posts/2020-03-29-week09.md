##### Why to Report Bugs
A blog post *[They Might Never Tell You It’s Broken][WHY_TO_REPORT_BUGS]* 
triggered me to report a problem in Inkscape's installation script which I briefly
wrote about on [this previous post][WEEK7]. The author says, "It’s a horrifying
thought, but it could be that for every one person who opens an issue on GitHub,
100 or more people have already tried your project, run into that same bug, and
simply moved on", and I thought that could be the case because I was did the 
exact same thing, just found a way out, and moved on. It could be hard if you
do not know much about the project, but from the maintainer's point of view, 
it could make new users or contributors leave because of it.



##### InkScape
We were discussing weather or not if we should work on their website project 
since some of the issues are more beginner friendly than the ones their core project has.

Completed:
- Read instruction on how to report bugs.
- Made a post to Inkscape's mailing list about a problem I had.
- Discussed how we are going forward with the project.
