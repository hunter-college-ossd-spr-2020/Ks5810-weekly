##### Talk by Vicky Brasseur
Notes
1. Incorrect definitions of FOSS
    - Making a project visible does not make it "Open Source"
    - So many people misunderstand what "Open Source" is
1. "Developer Central" culture in the community  
   - Problem
      - Missing large amount of users
   - Solution
      - Detailed Documentation
      - Improve User Interface:  
      Open Source Design
      - Enforcing Code of conduct
         - Coaching is important:  
         People have different standards
      - Do what people expects:  
         - Word processing software example:  
           Don't wanna feel stupid using tools
      - No Asshole Rule
1. Licencing
    - Secret source on projects:  
    GPL vs Apache
1. Using other projects  
Should depend on the problem not philosophy
1. Why open source?  
Science analogy
1. Minorities in tech  
Gender is not the only one; thus emphasising it not necessary
