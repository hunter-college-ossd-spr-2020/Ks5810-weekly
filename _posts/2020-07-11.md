##### [The Problem][Atcoder Aising 2020 C]
*Let &#402;(n) be the number of triples of integers (x, y, z) that satisfy both of the following conditions:*
- *1 &le; x, y, z*
- *x&sup2; + y&sup2; + z&sup2; + xy + yz + zx = n*

*Given an integer N, find each of &#402;(1), &#402;(2), &#402;(3), …, &#402;(N)*

- Input `N`: An integer  
- Output: Integers separated by newlines

###### Constraints
- All values in input are integers.
- 1 &le; N &le; 10&#8308;
- Should run in 2 sec

##### Solution
###### Brute Force
Getting the correct answer is easy for this question. For each numbers in the range of `1..N`, search all possible values of x, y, z where each value is less than or equal to `N`. However, the time complexity of this approach is *O(n&#8308;)*, and there is no way to execute this in two seconds when `N` gets large enough.
```cpp
int main()
{
    int n, res;
    cin >> n;
    
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
    {
        res = 0;
        for(int x = 1; x <= n; ++x)
        {
            for(int y = 1; y <= n; ++y)
            {
                for(int z = 1; z <= n; ++z)
                {
                    if(n == x * x + y * y + z * z + x * y + y * z + z * x)
                    {
                        res++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        cout << res << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```
When we think about the second condition carefully, we can see that the maximum value of each x, y, z won't be larger than *&radic;n* that means we could 
reduce the time complexity to *O(n&centerdot;n<sup>3&centerdot;1/2</sup>)* that is *O(n<sup>5/2</sup>)*. Although this looks much better than the above, it still takes `5.80` seconds with the input value of `5000` on my machine. 
```cpp
int main()
{
    int n, res;
    cin >> n;
    
    int sqrt_n = sqrt(n);
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
    {
        res = 0;
        for(int x = 1; x <= sqrt_n; ++x)
        {
            for(int y = 1; y <= sqrt_n; ++y)
            {
                for(int z = 1; z <= sqrt_n; ++z)
                {
                    if(i == x * x + y * y + z * z + x * y + y * z + z * x)
                    {
                        res++;
                    }    
                }
            }
        }
        cout << res << "\n";
    }
    return 0;
}
```
Notice that we do not have to compute for all *&#402;(1), &#402;(2), …, &#402;(N)*
because all possible values of *&#402;(n-1)* should appear in a process of calculating *&#402;(n)*. That said, let `res` be an array of integers with the size of `N+1`, the value of *&#402;(1), &#402;(2), …, &#402;(N)* can be computed by getting all possible values of x, y, z and increment the value of `res[n]` where `n` is equal to *x&sup2; + y&sup2; + z&sup2; + xy + yz + zx*. Since we 
no longer need the first iteration in the above code, the time complexity is reduced to *O(n<sup>3&centerdot;1/2</sup>)* which is *O(n<sup>3/2</sup>)*. 
```cpp
int main()
{
    int n, tmp;
    cin >> n;
    
    vector<int> res(n + 1);
    int sqrt_n = sqrt(n);
    
    for(int x = 1; x <= sqrt_n; ++x)
    {
        for(int y = 1; y <= sqrt_n; ++y)
        {
            for(int z = 1; z <= sqrt_n; ++z)
            {
                tmp = x * x + y * y + z * z + x * y + y * z + z * x;
                
                // tmp must be smaller than n
                if(tmp <= n)
                {
                    res[tmp]++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Skip res[0]
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
    {
        cout << res[i] << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```
When I run the above code with the input of `5000` again, it only takes `0.028` second, and it satisfies the time constraint.
