I decided to start writing about coding challenge problems that I could not solve or I found interesting.

##### [The Problem][leetcode 238]
*Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output\[i\] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums\[i\].*  
- Input `nums`: An array of integers  
- Output: An array of integers

##### Solutions
> ###### Brute Force
> We can easily get the solution by using two for loops. For all elements in `nums` multiply all other elements other than the element itself and store it in the output array in another loop. However, this answer would not be accepted because the problem explicitly states that the solution should run in O(n).

>     }
>     return res;
> }

> ###### Using Left and Right Arrays
> To solve it in the time complexity of O(n), we need to think about the problem a bit more. This approach uses two arrays that store the product of all the left or right elements of the element. For example, let `left` be an array to store the product of all the left elements, `left[i]`, of `nums[i]`. We can initialize the `left` array by iterating for all element in `nums` with index `i`, instantiate `left[i]` to the product of `left[i-1]` and `nums[i-1]`. This works because `left[i-1]` already has the product of `nums[0..i-2]`, so multiplying it by `nums[i-1]` yields the product of `nums[0..i-1]`. The same goes for the `right` array. Notice that we should initialize leftmost and rightmost elements in `left` and `right` to `1` because they do not have any element to their left or right. In C++, all elements in `vector` can be initialized to a specific value at declaration. Finally, we can get the output value by iterating for the size of `nums`, set `nums[i]` to the product of `left[i]` and `right[i]`. We can initialize the arrays in 2n iterations and set the result in n iterations, so the time complexity is O(3n) which can be simplified to O(n).

> If we need to solve it in O(1) space complexity, we can use just one array to store the output. This can be done by storing the product of the left elements to the output array first and then rewriting the value by multiplying the product of the right elements in the next loop, instead of declaring two arrays like the above.
